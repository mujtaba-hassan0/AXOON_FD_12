# Dummy API Integration

This is a simple web project demonstrating how to fetch data from a public API and display it on a webpage in a card format.

Features

✅ Data fetched from:
[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)


✅ Displays the first 10 posts on page load

✅ Each post is shown in a card with:

- UserId
- Title
- Body

✅ Handles errors using Promises with `.then()` and `.catch()`

✅ Shows an error message if the API request fails

How It Works

- By Clicking on Generate Posts Button, a `fetch` request is sent to the API.
